# Detection Continuous Improvement Plan

## 1. Purpose & Scope

Describe how feedback loops and lessons learned feed into tuning your detection capabilities.  
Define which detection artifacts (rules, processes, metrics) this covers.

---

## 2. Feedback Sources

- Incident post-mortems and root-cause analyses  
- Alert performance metrics (MTTD, TPR, FPR)  
- Security analyst and DevOps feedback  
- External threat intelligence reports  
- Red-team/penetration test findings  

---

## 3. Continuous Improvement Workflow

1. Collect Feedback  
   - Aggregate post-mortem action items  
   - Pull performance metrics from dashboards  
   - Gather analyst tuning requests  
2. Prioritize Improvements  
   - Score by impact (severity Ã— frequency)  
   - Estimate effort for changes  
3. Implement Updates  
   - Modify detection_rules.yaml or thresholds  
   - Update detection_processes.md and anomaly definitions  
4. Validate Changes  
   - Run detection_testing_plan.md scenarios  
   - Confirm metrics improve without regressions  
5. Deploy & Document  
   - Version and commit changes  
   - Record in change log (Section 7)  
6. Review Effectiveness  
   - Re-measure key metrics after 1 month  
   - Close the feedback loop in weekly tuning meetings  

---

## 4. Roles & Responsibilities

- Detection Engineers: apply and test rule updates  
- Security Analysts: validate rule efficacy in triage  
- DevOps/Platform Teams: deploy updated detection pipelines  
- SecOps Lead: chair weekly tuning meetings  
- Risk/Compliance: ensure changes meet policy requirements
