# Vulnerability Management Plan

## Purpose

This plan establishes a systematic approach to identify, assess, and remediate vulnerabilities in all City Library systems and applications. It ensures continuous visibility into security weaknesses and drives timely mitigation to reduce risk.

## Scope

Applies to all hardware, software, virtual machines, containers, network devices, cloud workloads, and web applications owned or managed by City Library IT.

---

## Vulnerability Inventory

Maintain an up-to-date inventory of:
- All servers, endpoints, network appliances, and cloud services  
- Internal and public-facing web applications and APIs  
- Containers and virtual machines in development, test, and production  

Review and reconcile this inventory quarterly to capture new assets.

---

## Scanning & Assessment

### Tools & Techniques

- Authenticated network scans with Qualys or Nessus  
- Agent-based scanning for endpoints (Microsoft Defender for Endpoint)  
- Container and code scans with Snyk or OWASP Dependency-Check  
- Web application tests via OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite  

### Schedule

| Scan Type                    | Frequency       | Scope                                  |
|------------------------------|-----------------|----------------------------------------|
| External perimeter scan      | Monthly         | Public IP ranges, DMZ hosts            |
| Internal network scan        | Quarterly       | All internal subnets                   |
| Critical asset scan          | Weekly          | Database servers, domain controllers   |
| Web application assessment   | After each build| All public-facing and internal apps    |
| Container & code scan        | With every CI/CD| All repositories in pipeline           |

---

## Risk Prioritization

1. Classify findings by CVSS score and business impact  
2. Critical (CVSS ≥ 9.0), High (7.0–8.9), Medium (4.0–6.9), Low (<4.0)  
3. Map to asset criticality and data sensitivity  
4. Produce a prioritized remediation queue each scan cycle

---

## Remediation & Mitigation

- Assign vulnerabilities to system owners within 24 hours of detection  
- Target remediation SLAs:  
  1. Critical: 15 days  
  2. High: 30 days  
  3. Medium: 60 days  
  4. Low: 90 days  
- If a fix can’t be deployed immediately, apply compensating controls (e.g., firewall rules, network segmentation)  
- Document all exceptions in the risk register with expiration dates and review cadence

---

## Verification & Closure

- Rescan remediated systems within 7 days to confirm fixes  
- For phased rollouts, track patch deployment status through endpoint management dashboards  
- Close tickets in the vulnerability management system only after successful verification

---

## Reporting & Metrics

| Metric                                  | Target            |
|-----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Percentage of systems scanned on schedule | 100%            |
| Time to remediate critical findings     | ≤ 15 days         |
| Number of open high/critical items      | ≤ 5 at any time   |
| Exception renewals overdue              | 0                 |
| Scan coverage (assets vs. inventory)    | ≥ 95%             |

Generate monthly reports for IT leadership and quarterly summaries for the Security Steering Committee.
