## 3. Playbook Details

### DRP-001: Data Center Outage

Description  
Guide to fail over processes and restore services at the secondary site when the primary data center is unreachable.

Steps  
1. Confirm outage via monitoring and vendor notifications.  
2. Declare DR event and notify stakeholders.  
3. Activate secondary site network and power circuits.  
4. Fail over DNS, load balancers, and storage replication targets.  
5. Start critical VMs from replicate storage snapshots.  
6. Execute sanity checks on essential services (web, database, authentication).  
7. Update incident ticket and communicate status to business units.

Success Criteria  
- Critical services operational at secondary site within RTO.  
- No more than defined RPO data loss.

### DRP-002: Ransomware Recovery

Description  
Step-by-step recovery from a ransomware infection, preserving evidence, restoring data, and hardening systems.

Steps  
1. Isolate infected segments and preserve forensic snapshots.  
2. Engage legal/forensic teams and collect logs.  
3. Wipe or rebuild compromised hosts from golden images.  
4. Restore data from verified backups.  
5. Patch systems to latest security baseline and rotate keys/passwords.  
6. Run full antivirus/malware scans and penetration tests.  
7. Bring systems back online and monitor for reinfection.

Success Criteria  
- Zero reinfection detections after 48 hours of monitoring.  
- Full data restoration with verified integrity.

### DRP-003: Mass Hardware Failure

Description  
Recovery plan when multiple servers, storage arrays, or network devices fail concurrently.

Steps  
1. Identify extent of hardware failure via monitoring alerts.  
2. Prioritize critical workloads and assemble recovery team.  
3. Provision replacement hardware or spin up virtual instances in DR lab.  
4. Redeploy system images and reattach storage LUNs.  
5. Execute functional tests and data validations.  
6. Decommission or repair failed hardware as per vendor SLA.  
7. Report recovery status and update configuration management database.

Success Criteria  
- All prioritized workloads back online within RTO.  
- Hardware replacement completed per support agreements.
