## 3. Process Details

### BRV-001: Backup Integrity Verification

Description  
Use automated checks and manual reviews to verify backup completeness and data integrity.

Steps  
1. Retrieve backup metadata and logs from the backup system.  
2. Run checksum/hash comparisons against source data.  
3. Log any discrepancies and categorize severity.  
4. Escalate integrity failures to Backup Administrator.  
5. Document results in the integrity check report.

Success Criteria  
- All backups pass checksum validation.  
- Discrepancies resolved within SLA.

---

### BRV-002: Restore Test Execution

Description  
Execute scheduled test restores in an isolated staging environment to validate recoverability.

Steps  
1. Select representative backup sets for full and partial restores.  
2. Provision staging infrastructure mirroring production.  
3. Initiate restore process following DR playbooks.  
4. Monitor for errors and performance metrics.  
5. Record restore duration, errors, and resource usage.

Success Criteria  
- Restores complete within target RTO.  
- No critical errors during restore.

---

### BRV-003: Restore Validation & Reporting

Description  
Validate that restored data and systems meet functional requirements and SLA thresholds.

Steps  
1. Run functional checks: user login, data access, transaction workflows.  
2. Compare data consistency against production snapshots.  
3. Measure performance metrics and verify against SLA.  
4. Compile validation report with pass/fail results.  
5. Distribute report for DR stakeholder sign-off.

Success Criteria  
- 100% of functional tests pass.  
- Validation report approved by DR Manager.

### BRV-004: Exception Handling & Remediation

Description  
Manage and remediate any failures identified during backup verification or restore testing.

Steps  
1. Log all exceptions in the ticketing system.  
2. Conduct root cause analysis of each failure.  
3. Implement corrective actions (e.g., reconfigure jobs, repair storage).  
4. Retest affected backups or restores.  
5. Close tickets once resolution and retest are successful.

Success Criteria  
- All exceptions resolved and retested successfully.  
- No overdue exception tickets beyond SLA.

### BRV-005: Audit & Compliance Review

Description  
Perform periodic audits to ensure backup and restore processes comply with internal policies and regulations.

Steps  
1. Gather all integrity and validation reports for the review period.  
2. Map processes against policy and regulatory controls.  
3. Identify control gaps and document findings.  
4. Recommend improvements and update SOPs.  
5. Present audit report to IT Governance and Compliance teams.

Success Criteria  
- Audit findings remediated within agreed timelines.  
- Updated SOPs published and communicated.
