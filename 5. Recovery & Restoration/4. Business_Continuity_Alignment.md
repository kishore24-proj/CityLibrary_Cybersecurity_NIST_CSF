## 3. Integration Steps

1. Review business process impact assessments to confirm RTO/RPO requirements.  
2. Map each recovery procedure (RCV-001 through RCV-006) to the supporting critical process.  
3. Align backup schedules and data replication frequency to meet RPO targets.  
4. Coordinate system failover and restoration timelines with business unit leads.  
5. Document any deviations and establish compensating controls or manual workarounds.  
6. Validate alignment during quarterly tabletop exercises and update runbooks.
