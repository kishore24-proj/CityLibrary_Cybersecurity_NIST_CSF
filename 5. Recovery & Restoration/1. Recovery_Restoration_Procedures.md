## 3. Process Details

### RCV-001: System Recovery

**Description**  
Rebuild or restore servers, workstations, and network devices using standardized images and configurations.

**Steps**  
1. Review the remediation completion ticket.  
2. Select appropriate system image from versioned repository.  
3. Deploy image to hardware or virtual instance.  
4. Apply network configurations and verify connectivity.  
5. Document build details and update asset inventory.

**Success Criteria**  
- 100% of target systems online within RTO.  
- All critical services reachable and responsive.

---

### RCV-002: Data Restoration

**Description**  
Recover databases, file shares, and application data from verified backups.

**Steps**  
1. Identify required backup snapshot with timestamp and retention check.  
2. Mount or extract data to staging environment.  
3. Validate integrity via checksums.  
4. Transfer data to production storage.  
5. Update recovery ticket and notify Application & Service Validation team.

**Success Criteria**  
- Zero data corruption errors.  
- Verification sign-off by data owner.

---

### RCV-003: Application & Service Validation

**Description**  
Execute functional and integrity tests on restored applications and services.

**Steps**  
1. Run automated smoke tests and health checks.  
2. Perform user-role simulations (e.g., login, search, checkout).  
3. Review logs for errors or performance bottlenecks.  
4. Escalate any failures to the appropriate owner.  
5. Record validation results and approve for live traffic.

**Success Criteria**  
- All critical transactions pass smoke tests.  
- No high-severity errors in logs for 30 minutes post-validation.

### RCV-004: User Access & Credential Reset

**Description**  
Re-establish user accounts, roles, and secure passwords after system rebuild.

**Steps**  
1. Retrieve account inventory for impacted user groups.  
2. Generate new temporary credentials and enforce password reset on first login.  
3. Update group memberships and role assignments.  
4. Notify users of credential changes via secure channel.  
5. Log all changes in IAM system.

**Success Criteria**  
- 100% of impacted users regain access without privilege issues.

### RCV-005: Configuration & Patch Application

**Description**  
Bring systems fully up to date with latest security patches and configuration standards.

**Steps**  
1. Query patch management system for pending updates.  
2. Schedule and apply patches outside of business hours if needed.  
3. Deploy configuration baseline scripts and verify settings.  
4. Reboot systems when required and confirm service availability.  
5. Document patch and config status in change log.

**Success Criteria**  
- No missing patches for critical CVEs.  
- Config drift ≤ 0.5% across restored systems.

### RCV-006: Post–Recovery Monitoring

**Description**  
Ensure restored systems remain stable and meet SLA performance.

**Steps**  
1. Activate heightened monitoring for all recovery-related services.  
2. Track key metrics: CPU, memory, response time, error rates.  
3. Review alerts and resolve issues within defined SLAs.  
4. Transition back to standard monitoring once stability confirmed.  
5. Close recovery incident after 24 hours of no critical alerts.

**Success Criteria**  
- Service availability ≥ 99.95% in 24-hour window post-recovery.
