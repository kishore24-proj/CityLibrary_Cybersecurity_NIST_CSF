# 8_Respond: Threat Intelligence & Vulnerability Management Plan

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines how the library’s security team will collect, analyze, and operationalize threat intelligence, and how vulnerability management activities will be coordinated with incident response. It ensures proactive risk reduction and faster detection of emerging threats.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Establish a structured threat-intelligence program to inform IR decisions.  
- Maintain a continuous vulnerability discovery, assessment, and remediation cycle.  
- Integrate intelligence feeds and vulnerability data into detection and playbooks.  
- Measure effectiveness through actionable metrics and feedback loops.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role                         | Responsibility                                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Threat Intelligence Lead     | Curates internal and external intelligence feeds; produces bulletins |
| Vulnerability Manager        | Oversees scanning, risk scoring, and patching coordination           |
| SOC Analysts                 | Consumes intelligence for IDS/EDR tuning and alert triage            |
| IT Operations                | Applies patches, configuration changes, and mitigations              |
| Incident Manager             | Incorporates new TTPs and CVEs into IR playbooks and workflows       |

## 4. Threat Intelligence Program

- Sources  
  * Open-source (OSINT) feeds—CIRCL, OTX, vendor blogs  
  * Commercial feeds—MISP, Recorded Future, CrowdStrike  
  * Internal telemetry—EDR, firewall, SIEM logs  

- Analysis  
  1. Triage intel for relevance (vertical: library-specific systems, data).  
  2. Map indicators of compromise (IOCs) to asset inventory.  
  3. Validate IOCs in test environment to reduce false positives.  

- Dissemination  
  * Weekly TI bulletin with new IOCs, TTPs, trending campaigns.  
  * Real-time alerts for critical or zero-day threats via Slack/Teams.

## 5. Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

1. Discovery  
   - Perform authenticated and unauthenticated scans (Nessus, Qualys) monthly.  
   - Track asset on-boarding and de-commissioning in CMDB.  
2. Assessment  
   - Risk-score vulnerabilities by CVSS, exploit maturity, asset criticality.  
   - Prioritize remediation in quarterly patch cycles or hot-fix for high-risk.  
3. Remediation  
   - Coordinate patch deployment with IT operations windows.  
   - Implement compensating controls (firewall rules, application hardening) where patching is delayed.  
4. Verification  
   - Rescan to confirm fixes.  
   - Update vulnerability status in ticketing system.  
5. Reporting  
   - Monthly dashboard for open/closed counts, time-to-remediate, and SLA compliance.  

---

## 6. Integration with Incident Response

- Enrich alerts and playbooks with emerging IOCs and CVE details.  
- Trigger ad-hoc vulnerability hunts when TI identifies targeted exploits.  
- Leverage vulnerability data to scope incident impact (e.g., unpatched host population).  
- Update IR runbooks to include steps for newly discovered vulnerability exploitations.
