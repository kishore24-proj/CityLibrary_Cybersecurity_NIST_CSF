# 4_Respond: Escalation Matrix (Library)

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This Escalation Matrix defines incident severity tiers, escalation criteria, responsible roles, and response time SLAs for library security and operational events. It ensures the right stakeholders are engaged at the right time to minimize impact.

## 2. Severity Levels & Criteria

| Level | Name                 | Criteria                                                               | Impact                                      |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| 1     | Informational        | Non-service-affecting events, routine errors                           | Minor, no downtime                          |
| 2     | Low                  | Single-branch disruption, degraded service but workaround available    | Localized impact, minimal patron inconvenience |
| 3     | Medium               | Multi-branch issues or critical system slowdowns                       | Noticeable downtime, moderate patron impact |
| 4     | High                 | Major system outage, data integrity concerns, potential PII exposure   | Significant downtime, widespread patron effect |
| 5     | Critical             | Safety incident (evacuation, threat), large-scale breach, regulatory escalations | Life/safety risk or legal/regulatory escalation |

## 5. Escalation Process Steps

1. Detect and classify event based on impact and criteria.  
2. Log the incident in the Incident Portal and assign a ticket with initial severity.  
3. Notify the designated role for that level via prescribed channels.  
4. Conduct assessment call or war-room meeting as per severity.  
5. Determine containment and mitigation actions.  
6. If unresolved within SLA, automatically escalate to next level and repeat notifications.  
7. Document every hand-off and decision in the Activity Log (ICS-214).

## 6. Approval & Review

- This matrix is approved by the IR Manager and Library Director.  
- Any changes require sign-off from the Executive Team.  
- All escalations and related decisions must be logged for audit and compliance.

---

## 7. Review Cycle

- Quarterly review by IR Manager and Communications Lead.  
- Annual validation alongside the full incident response playbook update.
