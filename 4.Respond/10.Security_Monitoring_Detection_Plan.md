# 9_Respond: Security Monitoring & Detection Plan

## 1. Purpose & Scope

This document defines the library’s security monitoring architecture, detection strategy, and alerting workflows. It ensures continuous visibility, rapid identification of threats, and seamless handoff to the incident response team.

---

## 2. Objectives

- Provide 24×7 monitoring of critical assets and networks.  
- Detect known and unknown threats through layered detection methods.  
- Minimize time to alert, acknowledge, and escalate.  
- Continuously refine detection logic to reduce noise and false positives.

## 3. Roles & Responsibilities

| Role                   | Responsibility                                                          |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitoring Lead        | Owns monitoring strategy, tool configuration, and rule tuning           |
| SOC Analyst            | Reviews alerts, performs initial triage, escalates validated incidents   |
| Incident Manager       | Coordinates handoff from detection to formal incident response           |
| IT Operations          | Ensures log sources, agents, and network taps remain active and healthy  |
| Application Owners     | Validate application-specific alerts and provide context for tuning      |

## 4. Monitoring Architecture & Coverage

- Infrastructure Logs  
  * Collect Windows Events, syslog, auditd, and Active Directory logs from all servers.  
- Network Traffic  
  * Deploy IDS/IPS sensors at Internet and internal segmentation points.  
  * Capture NetFlow or packet metadata for anomaly detection.  
- Endpoint Telemetry  
  * Enforce EDR agent on all workstations and servers; stream process, registry, and file alerts.  
- Cloud & Virtual Environments  
  * Ingest AWS CloudTrail, Azure Activity Logs, and Kubernetes audit logs.  
- Application & Database Logs  
  * Forward web server, API gateway, authentication, and database error logs to SIEM.

---

## 5. Alerting Strategy

- Signature-Based Rules  
  * Prebuilt and custom rules for known IOCs, malware patterns, and suspicious commands.  
- Anomaly-Based Detection  
  * Behavioral baselines for user logins, process launches, data transfers.  
- Threshold-Based Alerts  
  * Volume spikes in failed authentications or data egress beyond defined limits.  
- Multi-Source Correlation  
  * Combine endpoint, network, and log events to reduce single-source noise.

---

## 6. Tuning & False Positive Management

- Quarterly rule reviews to retire obsolete detections and refine thresholds.  
- Maintain suppression lists for approved software updates and known benign anomalies.  
- Host and user allowlists updated by SOC and Application Owners.  
- Post-incident retrospectives to adjust logic in response to missed detections or excess alerts.

## 8. Metrics & KPIs

| Metric                         | Definition                                             | Target               |
|--------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|----------------------|
| Alert Volume                   | Total alerts generated per month                       | ≤ 5,000              |
| Mean Time to Acknowledge (MTTA)| Average time from alert generation to SOC acknowledgment| ≤ 15 minutes         |
| Mean Time to Escalate (MTTE)   | Average time from acknowledgment to IR escalation      | ≤ 30 minutes         |
| False Positive Rate            | Percent of alerts deemed non-actionable after triage   | ≤ 10 percent         |
| Coverage Percentage            | Percent of critical assets with active log ingestion   | ≥ 99 percent         |

## 9. Review & Continuous Improvement

- Weekly SOC huddles to discuss high-priority and recurring alerts.  
- Monthly metrics review with IR Manager and Monitoring Lead.  
- Biannual red-team assessments to validate detection efficacy.  
- Incorporate new IOCs, TTPs, and vulnerability findings into detection logic.
