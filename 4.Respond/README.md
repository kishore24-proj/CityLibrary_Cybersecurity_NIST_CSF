# Incident Response Plan

## 1. Purpose

The goal of this Incident Response Plan is to minimize disruption to library operations, protect patron privacy, and preserve the integrity of our collections and digital resources. By establishing clear roles, communication channels, and step-by-step procedures, we ensure that any suspected or confirmed security incident is handled swiftly and consistently, safeguarding both physical and electronic assets while maintaining public trust.

## 2. Scope

This plan applies to all technology and information assets managed by the library, including but not limited to:

- Integrated Library System (ILS)  
- Online public access catalogs (OPAC) and digital archives  
- Patron and staff workstations (circulation desks, public terminals)  
- Wireless network infrastructure (guest Wi-Fi, staff VLANs)  
- Servers hosting e-resources, digital collections, and backups  
- Network equipment (routers, switches, firewalls)  
- Physical access controls (security cameras, badge readers)  
- IoT devices (self-checkout kiosks, printers, RFID gates)  
- Cloud-based services (e-mail, document storage, SaaS subscriptions)  

Incidents involving vendor-managed platforms (e.g., third-party e-book portals) must also follow these procedures, with coordination between library IT staff and external support teams.
